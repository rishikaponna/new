# Online Voting System
This is an Online Voting platform where we can hold any number of elections with "n" number of questions as required
This is built using HTML5,CSS3,TailWindCSS,EJS for front end and Node.js, Express.js for backend with PostgreSQL as database.
Here we can log in as an election adminnistrator and create multiple elections.
Each election can have multiple questions, with election admin power to control the voters for a particular election.
After the election has been created there is a live link that can be created where the voters can login and vote in it.
